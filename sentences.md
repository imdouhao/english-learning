There’s still some time for a deal to shake out

Some of Trump’s economic advisers have recently struck a different tone, arguing that the Fed needs to get inflation fully under control before lowering rates.

In a speech last week, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said another such turn-of-the-year jump in prices “will be a signal that monetary policy has more work to do.”

The tussle against this foe — or the specter of it — was waged off and on by officials for the better part of a generation, with critics contending Japan had become a poster child for seemingly terminal decline.

By 2003, inflation in the US had been so contained over the prior decade that policymakers fretted it had become too much of a good thing and the risk of a Japan scenario — once considered crazy — needed to be taken seriously.

That has perhaps created a fear over being too blasé on deflation. But the mistake the government risks repeating is being out of touch with the economy — and ignoring the issues facing everyday voters and consumers, who these days are struggling with higher grocery and utility bills.


While continuing to be cautious about the future, Japan should admit that at least for now it has won the fight. Otherwise, deflation risks becoming another of the interminable debates that drag on much too long in the country — from the future role of nuclear energy, to the use of surnames for married couples, to the current, excruciating debate over whether an income tax exemption should be merely modest, or really modest.

That these issues are still being chewed over when the broader world is moving at light speed — from the exponential growth of AI capability to the flurry of executive orders from the Trump administration — is particularly galling.

So while his reluctance to embrace Japan’s contemporary economy is grounded in harsh experience, it’s well past time for the political elite to move on. If you have a win, regardless of its provenance, take it. It’s good advice for any leader — and dare we say it, some useful forward guidance.

We can all exhibit some of these beliefs or behaviors in one way or another, and none of them is more adaptive or maladaptive than the other, it's all about balance.

what that can look like behaviorally is what some people call noble poverty, the idea that I have to not make a lot of money, because if I do make a lot of money or if I do have money, then that means that I'm a bad person.


 I think that we all exist in between all four of these kind of categories. But there tends to be, for most people, at least one or two that really stand out at any point, but I don't think that they're static throughout the course of our lives.

“The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” Musk’s lawyers declared. Altman said Musk was bitter he left before the company succeeded.


The danger to Europe lies in the interplay of three crucial factors: American disengagement, western European denialism and Russian determination.





Washington has been explaining for years to anyone willing to listen how Europe is slipping down its list of strategic global priorities — and the object lesson of the very different US approach to defending Israel against attack compared with defending Ukraine should have comprehensively **rammed the point home well** before Trump’s inauguration.




If these happen at the same speed as the new administration’s **slash-and-burn tactics** in other areas, they will be far too fast for Europe to react or compensate, leaving a dangerous and inviting gap for Russian assertiveness.

Europe, meanwhile, remains divided between the front-line states that recognise the risk and the urgency of mitigating it, and much of the continent’s western hinterland that remains semi-quiescent.

It was an odd lapse for one who is normally so polite.

As Doge has struggled to make headway, it has strained to paint a positive picture:

even going back to your original question about the myths and misconceptions of homelessness

we tend to think of people experiencing homelessness is kind of on the fringes of society. even spartially like you know homelessness in our minds tends to be confined to like Skid Row area.

we tend to think of homelessness as springing up in sort of areas of like extreme poverty, like images that have proliferated since 1980s when mass homelessness first exploded in the US.

 A few well-timed lines, delivered with confidence and fluency, can go further than pages of boilerplate.

Li Chenggang’s proverb in Geneva might have seemed like a throwaway line. But it worked because it sounded, well, human. As China navigates a more uncertain economic future, it may need more of that.

 The failure wasn’t just one of policy; it was often one of persuasion.

 The line wasn’t just rhetorical flair. It was a deliberate effort to frame China’s reform agenda in globally familiar language—and to signal that the CSRC is positioning itself as a guardian of long-term market health, not just a compliance enforcer.
